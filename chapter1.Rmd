# About the project

I'm totally newbie with R, so I expect a steep learning curve from this course. Unfortunately I'm also very busy during first two weeks of the course with other dead lines, so I hope I don't fall off the wagon right away because I don't have as much time available for coursework as I would like. I have been wanting to learn R for a while now, so I was delighted when I found this course from SISU. I'm using a couple of R based webtools for coding and analyzing my data for my PhD and even though I don't need to know R to use those tools I believe that learning R will be helpful for me, at least in my future research if not with this ongoing paper.\
Here are links for the webtools I'm using:\

- [ENA webtool](https://www.epistemicnetwork.org/)\

I haven't gotten very far with the **R for Health Data Science** book and the **Exercise Set 1** yet, but so far everything has been interesting and I've liked the way you can run the code at the same time while reading the book. For some reason the R studio on my computer is working really slow though, and *that sure can be a bit annoying at times*. Also, I got some weird error messages when I tried to run some of the code chunks in Exercise 1. Maybe I haven't got everything properly installed or up to date? I have to look into it.
NB! Problem solved. I had an old version of R on my computer and everything started to work after I updated that.
